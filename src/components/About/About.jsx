      <p>
        I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for UI/UX and front-end
        development. Based in Toronto, I have a unique background in fashion,
        piano performance and music pedagogy. Always curious about the web, I
        graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program
        where I learned full-stack development in a fast-paced environment.
